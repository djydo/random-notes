## Python Notebook Deep Learning Tools

### [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/)
- The tool is for loading a Python notebook with a long line of codes that is failing to load on GitHub.
- The tool is also handy for comparing differences between multiple versions of Git commit.

### [MakeSense AI](https://www.makesense.ai/)
- This is used for labeling images for object detection
- The tool is not able to create output that can perform object detection with segmentation

### [Neptune AI](https://neptune.ai/)
- This tool is used for logging different iterations of Python notebook runs
- Several parameters and metrics can be tracked and monitored between the iterations
- NeptuneAI makes it easy to track progress of experimentations and compare evaluation metrics

### Hyperparameter Tuning
 - The list includes tools like Ray Tune, Optuna, Hyperopt, Sckit-Optimize, Google Vizer, Microsoft's NNI etc.
